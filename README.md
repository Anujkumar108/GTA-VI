## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**GSAP** — A powerful JavaScript animation library used to create dynamic, scroll-driven visuals.  
Features include SplitText animations for bold text reveals, ScrollTrigger for timeline control, parallax scrolling, pinned sections, scroll-synced video playback, seamless multi-section timelines, image masking effects, and a fully custom animated carousel.

**React** — A declarative JavaScript library for building interactive UIs.  
It provides a component structure for modular development, allowing smooth integration of GSAP animations, reusable logic for scroll behavior, and support for responsive layouts and state-driven UI features like carousels and video sections.

**Tailwind CSS** — A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom UIs by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.

**Vite** — A lightning-fast build tool and development server that powers the workflow.  
It enables instant hot module replacement, fast startup, and optimized production builds — ideal for animation-heavy React sites with smooth real-time development feedback and minimal configuration.
